# Group12_Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
## Problem Definition:
A credit card remains a very widespread compensation method that is accepted online & offline, and provides cashless transactions. With the increase of developments credit card frauds are also growing. Billion dollars are at loss due to these fraudulent acts. In directive to minimalize disorder and bring order in place, having a well-organized method of fraud detection has become a need for all banks. A machine learning based technique is proposed in this direction to detect the credit card frauds are also growing.

A machine learning based technique is proposed in this direction to detect the credit card frauds.

Algorithms such as Random Forest, Isolation Forest, SVM, LOF, KNN, Naive Bayes, Genetic algorithms etc. are used to increase the chances of accuracy.
Performance comparison of the above mentioned algorithms to analyse the best technique in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.
